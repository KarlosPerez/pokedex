# Simple Pokedex App

A simple pokedex app showing the list and detail of the first 151 pokemon. 

## Purpose

This is created just for practice, following a tutorial; I used realim1's endpoint at https://github.com/realim1/pokemonGo-json/blob/master/PokemonGo.json, to get pokemon info. At this point, I'm getting used loading a list of items using adapters and recycler views.

### What you can find in this project

This is a simple app, it loads a pokemon list and detail. I used the following libraries and assets:

* CardView and RecyclerView to show pokemon info
* ChipView for colored pokemon type (com.robertlevonyan.view:MaterialChipView:1.2.4)
* Retrofit for requests to the API
* LocalBroadcastManager and BroadcastReceiver for fragments replacement
